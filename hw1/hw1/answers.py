part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. **False.** Test set allows us to test the trained model and estimate it's ability of generalization.
2. **False.** The split is affected by the representativeness of train and test set.
3. **True.** The goal of cross-validation is to test the model's ability to predict new data that was not used in estimating it.
4. **True.** It's not a perfect indicator of model generalizability simply because we DO see the model performance on the validation set, and so we subconsciously tune hyperparameters to better fit the validation set accuracy (or in the case of k-fold cross-validation, validation set(s). A better evaluation of a models generalizability is on a "test" set.

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:** 

It's not a good approach. Now he just overfiiting regarding to the test set, he doesn't improve generalizabilty. It can result in minor improvement, but this approach is not justified.
